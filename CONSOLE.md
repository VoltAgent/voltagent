## What is VoltOps?

> **LLM Observability** is the practice of monitoring, tracking, and understanding the behavior of AI agents and language models in production. Unlike traditional software monitoring that focuses on system metrics, LLM observability provides visibility into the decision-making process, tool usage patterns, conversation flows, and performance characteristics of intelligent systems.

**VoltOps** is a framework-agnostic observability platform specifically designed for AI agents and LLM applications. Built by the team behind VoltAgent - an open-source AI agent framework - VoltOps addresses the real debugging challenges that arise when agents interact with tools, make complex decisions, and handle multi-step workflows.

Instead of relying on traditional text-based logs that become overwhelming with complex agent interactions, VoltOps provides:

- **Visual Workflow Monitoring**: Interactive flowcharts that show agent decision-making processes in real-time
- **Framework-Agnostic Integration**: Works with any technology stack through multiple integration options
- **Real-Time Debugging**: Watch your agents think and act with virtually zero latency between action and visualization
- **Complete Workflow Visibility**: Track entire agent processes from initial input to final response
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Visualize parent-child relationships and hierarchies across agent systems
- **Tool Execution Tracking**: Monitor complete tool call sequences with inputs, outputs, and performance metrics
- **Production-Ready Monitoring**: Get immediate alerts for failures, loops, and performance issues

VoltOps transforms the black-box nature of AI agents into transparent, understandable workflows that you can monitor, debug, and optimize.

## Why VoltOps?

Building AI agents that work reliably in production is fundamentally different from traditional software development. Here's why standard monitoring approaches fall short and how VoltOps solves these challenges:

### The Problem: Traditional Monitoring Fails for AI

**AI Agents Are Black Boxes**
Unlike traditional applications where you can follow code paths, AI agents make decisions through neural networks. Without observability, you can't understand why an agent chose one tool over another, or why it generated a specific response.

**Complex Multi-Step Workflows**
Modern AI agents don't just answer questions - they plan, execute tools, analyze results, and make sequential decisions. When something goes wrong in a 10-step workflow, you need to see exactly where and why.

**Non-Deterministic Behavior**
The same input can produce different outputs with AI agents. This makes traditional debugging approaches ineffective. You need to track patterns across multiple executions to understand agent behavior.

**Tool Integration Complexity**
AI agents interact with external APIs, databases, and services. When tools fail or return unexpected data, you need visibility into the entire tool execution chain to diagnose issues.

### The Solution: Agent-Centric Observability

**Built by AI Agent Framework Builders**
VoltOps is built by the VoltAgent team - open source AI agent framework maintainers who understand the real challenges of building production AI agents. Every feature comes from actual pain points reported by developers building AI agents in production.

**Real-Time Visual Debugging**
Watch your agents think and act in real-time through interactive flowcharts. No waiting for batch processing or delayed dashboards - see execution flow as it happens.

**Framework-Agnostic Design**
Works with any technology stack through multiple integration options - from native SDK support to universal REST API integration. Whether you're using VoltAgent, Vercel AI SDK, or building custom solutions.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Experience VoltOps Instantly

Try VoltOps with our interactive demo - no setup required:

**[🚀 Launch Live Demo](https://console.voltagent.dev/demo)**

### For VoltAgent Users (Zero Configuration)

If you're using VoltAgent Framework, observability is automatically enabled:

```bash
npm create voltagent-app@latest my-agent-app
cd my-agent-app
```

**Add your API key**: Create or edit the `.env` file in your project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

_Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)_

Then, run your VoltAgent application locally. When you run the `dev` command (e.g., `npm run dev`), you should see the VoltAgent server startup message in your terminal:

```bash
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  VOLTAGENT SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ HTTP Server: http://localhost:3141

  VoltOps Platform:    https://console.voltagent.dev
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
[VoltAgent] All packages are up to date
```

Visit [console.voltagent.dev](https://console.voltagent.dev/) to see your agent in real-time.

When you run a VoltAgent application locally with observability enabled, it exposes a local server (typically on port `3141`). The VoltOps connects directly to this local server via your browser.

- **Local Connection:** Communication happens directly between the console in your browser and your local agent process. No data is sent to external servers.
- **Real-time Data:** Observe agent activities as they happen.

### For Vercel AI SDK Users

Add observability to your existing Vercel AI applications:

```bash
npm install @voltagent/vercel-ai-exporter @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
```

```typescript
import { VoltAgentExporter } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai-exporter";
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Initialize VoltOps observability
const voltAgentExporter = new VoltAgentExporter({
  publicKey: process.env.VOLTAGENT_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.VOLTAGENT_SECRET_KEY,
  debug: true,
});

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: voltAgentExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});

sdk.start();

// Your existing Vercel AI code with observability
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: "What's the weather like in Tokyo?",
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      agentId: "weather-assistant",
      userId: "demo-user",
      conversationId: "weather-chat",
    },
  },
});
```

### For Other Frameworks

const trace = await sdk.trace({
  name: "Customer Support Query",
  agentId: "support-agent",
  input: { query: "How to reset password?" },
  userId: "user-123",
});

// Add an agent to handle the request
const agent = await trace.addAgent({
