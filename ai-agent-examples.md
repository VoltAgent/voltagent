Each folder here contains a runnable example demonstrating how to build or integrate an AI Agent using [VoltAgent](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent).

These projects demonstrate RAG retrieval, typed tools, persistent memory, supervisor-subagent orchestration, workflows, MCP tool integration, and voice/UX integrations. Use them as reference implementations or starting points for your applications.

VoltAgent is a TypeScript-based framework for building AI agents with modern tooling. Get started with the [tutorial](https://voltagent.dev/tutorial/introduction/) to learn the fundamentals and build your first agent.

## What You'll Build

- **RAG & Retrieval** — Vector search with Pinecone, Chroma, Qdrant, and Postgres.
- **Typed Tools** — Zod-validated tools, MCP servers, and external API integration.
- **Memory Systems** — Working memory, persistent storage, and context management.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Supervisor patterns, sub-agents, and workflows.
- **Deployments** — Next.js, Cloudflare Workers, Netlify Functions, and more.
