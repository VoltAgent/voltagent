      "input": "What was the purpose and outcome of the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, and what key principle did it establish regarding colonial claims in Africa?",
      "expected": "European powers met (without African representation) to regulate colonization and trade in Africa, formalizing the Scramble for Africa. The conference recognized the Congo Free State under King Leopold II, guaranteed free navigation on the Congo and Niger rivers, and—most importantly—established the principle of “effective occupation,” requiring actual administrative control for a state to claim territory."

      "input": "Who was Mansa Musa, and why was his 1324 pilgrimage to Mecca significant for West Africa and the wider Mediterranean world?",
      "expected": "Mansa Musa I was the ruler of the Mali Empire (c. 1312–1337). His 1324 hajj showcased Mali’s vast wealth in gold, distributing so much in Cairo that it depressed gold prices for years. The pilgrimage forged diplomatic and commercial ties with Egypt and the broader Islamic world, expanded trans-Saharan trade, and elevated Mali’s prestige. He patronized Islamic learning and architecture (e.g., commissioning the Djinguereber Mosque in Timbuktu), helping make Timbuktu a center of scholarship. His fame also put West Africa prominently on European maps, such as the 1375 Catalan Atlas."
