## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#596](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/596) [`355836b`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/355836b39a6d1ba36c5cfac82008cab3281703e7) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - - add `@voltagent/a2a-server`, a JSON-RPC Agent-to-Agent (A2A) server that lets external agents call your VoltAgent instance over HTTP/SSE
  - teach `@voltagent/core`, `@voltagent/server-core`, and `@voltagent/server-hono` to auto-register configured A2A servers so adding `{ a2aServers: { ... } }` on `VoltAgent` and opting into `honoServer` instantly exposes discovery and RPC endpoints
  - forward request context (`userId`, `sessionId`, metadata) into agent invocations and provide task management hooks, plus allow filtering/augmenting exposed agents by default
  - document the setup in `website/docs/agents/a2a/a2a-server.md` and refresh `examples/with-a2a-server` with basic usage and task-store customization
  - A2A endpoints are now described in Swagger/OpenAPI and listed in the startup banner whenever an A2A server is registered, making discovery of `/.well-known/...` and `/a2a/:serverId` routes trivial.

  **Getting started**

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { A2AServer } from "@voltagent/a2a-server";
  import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "SupportAgent",
    purpose: "Handle support questions from partner agents.",
    model: myModel,
  });

  const a2aServer = new A2AServer({
    name: "support-agent",
    version: "0.1.0",
  });

  export const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    a2aServers: { a2aServer },
    server: honoServer({ port: 3141 }),
  });
  ```
