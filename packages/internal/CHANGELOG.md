### Patch Changes

- [#596](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/596) [`355836b`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/355836b39a6d1ba36c5cfac82008cab3281703e7) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - - add `@voltagent/a2a-server`, a JSON-RPC Agent-to-Agent (A2A) server that lets external agents call your VoltAgent instance over HTTP/SSE
  - teach `@voltagent/core`, `@voltagent/server-core`, and `@voltagent/server-hono` to auto-register configured A2A servers so adding `{ a2aServers: { ... } }` on `VoltAgent` and opting into `honoServer` instantly exposes discovery and RPC endpoints
  - forward request context (`userId`, `sessionId`, metadata) into agent invocations and provide task management hooks, plus allow filtering/augmenting exposed agents by default
  - document the setup in `website/docs/agents/a2a/a2a-server.md` and refresh `examples/with-a2a-server` with basic usage and task-store customization
  - A2A endpoints are now described in Swagger/OpenAPI and listed in the startup banner whenever an A2A server is registered, making discovery of `/.well-known/...` and `/a2a/:serverId` routes trivial.

  **Getting started**

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { A2AServer } from "@voltagent/a2a-server";
  import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "SupportAgent",
    purpose: "Handle support questions from partner agents.",
    model: myModel,
  });

  const a2aServer = new A2AServer({
    name: "support-agent",
    version: "0.1.0",
  });

  export const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    a2aServers: { a2aServer },
    server: honoServer({ port: 3141 }),
  });
  ```

  - Wire MCP registration through `@voltagent/core`, `@voltagent/server-core`, and `@voltagent/server-hono` so a single `VoltAgent` constructor opt-in (optionally with `honoServer`) exposes stdio mode immediately and HTTP/SSE endpoints when desired.
  - Filter child sub-agents automatically and lift an agent's `purpose` (fallback to `instructions`) into the MCP tool description for cleaner IDE listings out of the box.
  - Document the workflow in `website/docs/agents/mcp/mcp-server.md` and refresh `examples/with-mcp-server` with stdio-only and HTTP/SSE configurations.
  - When MCP is enabled we now publish REST endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI and echo them in the startup banner so you can discover `/mcp/*` routes without digging through code.

  **Getting started**

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { MCPServer } from "@voltagent/mcp-server";
  import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "AssistantAgent",
    purpose: "Respond to support questions and invoke helper tools when needed.",
    model: myModel,
  });

  const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
    name: "support-mcp",
    version: "1.0.0",
    agents: { assistant },
    protocols: { stdio: true, http: false, sse: false },
  });

  export const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    mcpServers: { primary: mcpServer },
    server: honoServer({ port: 3141 }), // flip http/sse to true when you need remote clients
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [`5968cef`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/5968cef5fe417cd118867ac78217dddfbd60493d) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - chore: remove console.warn from deepClone function

  Removed the console.warn statement from the deepClone function's error handling. Since we require Node.js 17+ where structuredClone is always available, this warning is unnecessary and can clutter logs in development environments.

  ## What Changed
  - Removed `console.warn("Failed to deep clone object, using shallow clone", { error });` from the catch block
  - Kept the fallback logic intact for edge cases
  - Maintained the development-only condition check even though the warning is removed

  This change reduces unnecessary console output while maintaining the same fallback behavior for shallow cloning when structuredClone fails.

### Patch Changes

- [`90a1316`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/90a131622a876c0d91e1b9046a5e1fc143fef6b5) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - fix: improve code quality with biome linting and package configuration enhancements

  This update focuses on improving code quality and package configuration across the entire VoltAgent monorepo:

  **Key improvements:**
  - **Biome Linting**: Fixed numerous linting issues identified by Biome across all packages, ensuring consistent code style and catching potential bugs
  - **Package Configuration**: Added `publint` script to all packages for strict validation of package.json files to ensure proper publishing configuration
  - **TypeScript Exports**: Fixed `typesVersions` structure in @voltagent/internal package and removed duplicate entries
  - **Test Utilities**: Refactored `createTrackedStorage` function in core package by simplifying its API - removed the `testName` parameter for cleaner test setup
  - **Type Checking**: Enabled `attw` (Are The Types Wrong) checking to ensure TypeScript types are correctly exported

  These changes improve the overall maintainability and reliability of the VoltAgent framework without affecting the public API.

### Patch Changes

- [#404](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/404) [`809bd13`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/809bd13c5fce7b2afdb0f0d934cc5a21d3e77726) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - refactor: remove devLogger in favor of standardized logging approach

  Removed the internal `devLogger` utility to align with the new standardized logging architecture. This change simplifies the internal package and reduces code duplication by leveraging the comprehensive logging system now available in @voltagent/core and @voltagent/logger.

  **Changes:**
  - Removed `devLogger` from exports
  - Removed development-only logging utility
  - Consumers should use the logger instance provided by VoltAgent or create their own using @voltagent/logger

  This is part of the logging system refactoring to provide a more consistent and powerful logging experience across all VoltAgent packages.

### Patch Changes

- [#324](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/324) [`8da1ecc`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/8da1eccd0332d1f9037085e16cb0b7d5afaac479) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: improve dev logger environment detection and add debug method

  Enhanced the dev logger to be more intelligent about when to show logs. Previously, the logger only showed logs when `NODE_ENV === "development"`. Now it shows logs unless `NODE_ENV` is explicitly set to `"production"`, `"test"`, or `"ci"`.

  **Changes:**
  - **Improved Environment Detection**: Dev logger now shows logs when `NODE_ENV` is undefined, empty string, or any value other than "production", "test", or "ci"
  - **Better Developer Experience**: Developers who don't set NODE_ENV will now see logs by default, which is more intuitive
  - **Added Debug Method**: Included a placeholder `debug` method for future structured logging with Pino
  - **Updated Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for the new logging behavior

  **Before:**
  - Logs only shown when `NODE_ENV === "development"`
  - Empty string or undefined NODE_ENV = no logs ❌

  **After:**
  - Logs hidden only when `NODE_ENV === "production"`, `NODE_ENV === "test"`, or `NODE_ENV === "ci"`
  - Empty string, undefined, or other values = logs shown ✅

  This change makes the development experience smoother as most developers don't explicitly set NODE_ENV during local development.

### Patch Changes

- [#311](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/311) [`1f7fa14`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/1f7fa140fcc4062fe85220e61f276e439392b0b4) Thanks [@zrosenbauer](https://github.com/zrosenbauer)! - fix(core, vercel-ui): Currently the `convertToUIMessages` function does not handle tool calls in steps correctly as it does not properly default filter non-tool related steps for sub-agents, same as the `data-stream` functions and in addition in the core the `operationContext` does not have the `subAgent` fields set correctly.

  ### Changes
  - deprecated `isSubAgentStreamPart` in favor of `isSubAgent` for universal use
  - by default `convertToUIMessages` now filters out non-tool related steps for sub-agents
  - now able to exclude specific parts or steps (from OperationContext) in `convertToUIMessages`

  ***

  ### Internals

  New utils were added to the internal package:
  - `isObject`
  - `isFunction`
  - `isPlainObject`
  - `isEmptyObject`
  - `isNil`
  - `hasKey`

### Patch Changes

- [`94de46a`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/94de46ab2b7ccead47a539e93c72b357f17168f6) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: add `deepClone` function to `object-utils` module

  Added a new `deepClone` utility function to the object-utils module for creating deep copies of complex JavaScript objects. This utility provides safe cloning of nested objects, arrays, and primitive values while handling circular references and special object types.

  Usage:

  ```typescript
  import { deepClone } from "@voltagent/core/utils/object-utils";

  const original = {
    nested: {
      array: [1, 2, { deep: "value" }],
      date: new Date(),
    },
  };

  const cloned = deepClone(original);
  // cloned is completely independent from original
  ```

  This utility is particularly useful for agent state management, configuration cloning, and preventing unintended mutations in complex data structures.
