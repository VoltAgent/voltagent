### Patch Changes

- [#311](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/311) [`1f7fa14`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/1f7fa140fcc4062fe85220e61f276e439392b0b4) Thanks [@zrosenbauer](https://github.com/zrosenbauer)! - fix(core, vercel-ui): Currently the `convertToUIMessages` function does not handle tool calls in steps correctly as it does not properly default filter non-tool related steps for sub-agents, same as the `data-stream` functions and in addition in the core the `operationContext` does not have the `subAgent` fields set correctly.

  ### Changes

  - deprecated `isSubAgentStreamPart` in favor of `isSubAgent` for universal use
  - by default `convertToUIMessages` now filters out non-tool related steps for sub-agents
  - now able to exclude specific parts or steps (from OperationContext) in `convertToUIMessages`

  ***

  ### Internals

  New utils were added to the internal package:

  - `isObject`
  - `isFunction`
  - `isPlainObject`
  - `isEmptyObject`
  - `isNil`
  - `hasKey`

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [`94de46a`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/94de46ab2b7ccead47a539e93c72b357f17168f6) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: add `deepClone` function to `object-utils` module

  Added a new `deepClone` utility function to the object-utils module for creating deep copies of complex JavaScript objects. This utility provides safe cloning of nested objects, arrays, and primitive values while handling circular references and special object types.

  Usage:

  ```typescript
  import { deepClone } from "@voltagent/core/utils/object-utils";

  const original = {
    nested: {
      array: [1, 2, { deep: "value" }],
      date: new Date(),
    },
  };

  const cloned = deepClone(original);
  // cloned is completely independent from original
  ```

  This utility is particularly useful for agent state management, configuration cloning, and preventing unintended mutations in complex data structures.
