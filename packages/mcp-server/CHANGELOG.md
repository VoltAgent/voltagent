## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#659](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/659) [`c4d13f2`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/c4d13f2be129013eed6392990863ae85cdbd8855) Thanks [@marinoska](https://github.com/marinoska)! - Add first-class support for client-side tool calls and Vercel AI hooks integration.

  This enables tools to run in the browser (no execute function) while the model remains on the server. Tool calls are surfaced to the client via Vercel AI hooks (useChat/useAssistant), executed with access to browser APIs, and their results are sent back to the model using addToolResult with the original toolCallId.

  Highlights:
  - Define a client-side tool by omitting the execute function.
  - Automatic interception of tool calls on the client via onToolCall in useChat/useAssistant.
  - Report outputs and errors back to the model via addToolResult(toolCallId, payload), preserving conversation state.
  - Example added/updated: examples/with-client-side-tools (Next.js + Vercel AI).

  Docs:
  - README: Clarifies client-side tool support and where it fits in the stack.
  - website/docs/agents/tools.md: New/updated “Client-Side Tools” section, end-to-end flow with useChat/useAssistant, addToolResult usage, and error handling.

### Patch Changes

- [#596](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/596) [`355836b`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/355836b39a6d1ba36c5cfac82008cab3281703e7) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - ## ✨ New: first-class Model Context Protocol support

  We shipped a complete MCP integration stack:
  - `@voltagent/mcp-server` exposes VoltAgent registries (agents, workflows, tools) over stdio/HTTP/SSE transports.
  - `@voltagent/server-core` and `@voltagent/server-hono` gained ready-made route handlers so HTTP servers can proxy MCP traffic with a few lines of glue code.
  - `@voltagent/core` exports the shared types that the MCP layers rely on.

  ### Quick start

  ```ts title="src/mcp/server.ts"
  import { MCPServer } from "@voltagent/mcp-server";
  import { Agent, createTool } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
  import { z } from "zod";

  const status = createTool({
    name: "status",
    description: "Return the current time",
    parameters: z.object({}),
    async execute() {
      return { status: "ok", time: new Date().toISOString() };
    },
  });

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "Support Agent",
    instructions: "Route customer tickets to the correct queue.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools: [status],
  });

  export const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
    name: "voltagent-example",
    version: "0.1.0",
    description: "Expose VoltAgent over MCP",
    agents: { support: assistant },
    tools: { status },
    filterTools: ({ items }) => items.filter((tool) => tool.name !== "debug"),
  });
  ```

  With the server registered on your VoltAgent instance (and the Hono MCP routes enabled), the same agents, workflows, and tools become discoverable from VoltOps Console or any MCP-compatible IDE.

  - Wire MCP registration through `@voltagent/core`, `@voltagent/server-core`, and `@voltagent/server-hono` so a single `VoltAgent` constructor opt-in (optionally with `honoServer`) exposes stdio mode immediately and HTTP/SSE endpoints when desired.
  - Filter child sub-agents automatically and lift an agent's `purpose` (fallback to `instructions`) into the MCP tool description for cleaner IDE listings out of the box.
  - Document the workflow in `website/docs/agents/mcp/mcp-server.md` and refresh `examples/with-mcp-server` with stdio-only and HTTP/SSE configurations.
  - When MCP is enabled we now publish REST endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI and echo them in the startup banner so you can discover `/mcp/*` routes without digging through code.

  **Getting started**

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { MCPServer } from "@voltagent/mcp-server";
  import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "AssistantAgent",
    purpose: "Respond to support questions and invoke helper tools when needed.",
    model: myModel,
  });

  const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
    name: "support-mcp",
    version: "1.0.0",
    agents: { assistant },
    protocols: { stdio: true, http: false, sse: false },
  });

  export const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    mcpServers: { primary: mcpServer },
    server: honoServer({ port: 3141 }), // flip http/sse to true when you need remote clients
  });
  ```
