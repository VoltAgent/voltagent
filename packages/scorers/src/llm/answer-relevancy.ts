const QUESTION_GEN_PROMPT = `Generate a question for the given answer and Identify if answer is noncommittal. Give noncommittal as 1 if the answer is noncommittal and 0 if the answer is committal. A noncommittal answer is one that is evasive, vague, or ambiguous. For example, "I don't know" or "I'm not sure" are noncommittal answers

Examples:

answer: "Albert Einstein was born in Germany."
context: "Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time"
output: {"question": "Where was Albert Einstein born?", "noncommittal": 0}

answer: "It can change its skin color based on the temperature of its environment."
context: "A recent scientific study has discovered a new species of frog in the Amazon rainforest that has the unique ability to change its skin color based on the temperature of its environment."
output: {"question": "What unique ability does the newly discovered species of frog have?", "noncommittal": 0}

answer: "Everest"
context: "The tallest mountain on Earth, measured from sea level, is a renowned peak located in the Himalayas."
output: {"question": "What is the tallest mountain on Earth?", "noncommittal": 0}

answer: "I don't know about the  groundbreaking feature of the smartphone invented in 2023 as am unaware of information beyond 2022. "
context: "In 2023, a groundbreaking invention was announced: a smartphone with a battery life of one month, revolutionizing the way people use mobile technology."
output: {"question": "What was the groundbreaking feature of the smartphone invented in 2023?", "noncommittal": 1}
