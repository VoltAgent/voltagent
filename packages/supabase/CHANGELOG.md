### Patch Changes

- [#21](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/21) [`8c3506e`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/8c3506e27486ac371192ef9ffb6a997e8e1692e9) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: Introduce Supabase Memory Provider (`@voltagent/supabase`)

  This new package provides a persistent memory solution for VoltAgent using Supabase.

  **Features:**

  - Stores conversation history, agent history entries, events, and steps in your Supabase database.
  - Requires specific table setup in your Supabase project (SQL provided in the package README).
  - Easy integration by initializing `SupabaseMemory` with your Supabase URL and key and passing it to your `Agent` configuration.

  See the `@voltagent/supabase` [README](https://github.com/voltagent/voltagent/blob/main/packages/supabase/README.md) and [Documentation](https://voltagent.dev/docs/agents/memory/supabase/) for detailed setup and usage instructions.
