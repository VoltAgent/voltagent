- ðŸš€ **Introducing VoltAgent: TypeScript AI Agent Framework!**

  This initial release marks the beginning of VoltAgent, a powerful toolkit crafted for the JavaScript developer community. We saw the challenges: the complexity of building AI from scratch, the limitations of No-Code tools, and the lack of first-class AI tooling specifically for JS.

  ![VoltAgent Demo](https://cdn.voltagent.dev/readme/demo.gif)
  VoltAgent aims to fix that by providing the building blocks you need:

  - **`@voltagent/core`**: The foundational engine for agent capabilities.
  - **`@voltagent/voice`**: Easily add voice interaction.
  - **`@voltagent/vercel-ai`**: Seamless integration with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).
  - **`@voltagent/xsai`**: A Seamless integration with [xsAI](https://xsai.js.org/).
  - **`@voltagent/cli` & `create-voltagent-app`**: Quick start tools to get you building _fast_.

  We're combining the flexibility of code with the clarity of visual tools (like our **currently live [VoltAgent Console](https://console.voltagent.dev/)**) to make AI development easier, clearer, and more powerful. Join us as we build the future of AI in JavaScript!
