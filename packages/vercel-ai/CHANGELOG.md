### Patch Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/71) [`1f20509`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/1f20509528fc2cb2ba00f86d649848afae34af04) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: Standardize Agent Error and Finish Handling

  This change introduces a more robust and consistent way errors and successful finishes are handled across the `@voltagent/core` Agent and LLM provider implementations (like `@voltagent/vercel-ai`).

  **Key Improvements:**

  - **Standardized Errors (`VoltAgentError`):**

    - Introduced `VoltAgentError`, `ToolErrorInfo`, and `StreamOnErrorCallback` types in `@voltagent/core`.
    - LLM Providers (e.g., Vercel) now wrap underlying SDK/API errors into a structured `VoltAgentError` before passing them to `onError` callbacks or throwing them.
    - Agent methods (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`) now consistently handle `VoltAgentError`, enabling richer context (stage, code, tool details) in history events and logs.

  - **Standardized Stream Finish Results:**

    - Introduced `StreamTextFinishResult`, `StreamTextOnFinishCallback`, `StreamObjectFinishResult`, and `StreamObjectOnFinishCallback` types in `@voltagent/core`.
    - LLM Providers (e.g., Vercel) now construct these standardized result objects upon successful stream completion.
    - Agent streaming methods (`streamText`, `streamObject`) now receive these standardized results in their `onFinish` handlers, ensuring consistent access to final output (`text` or `object`), `usage`, `finishReason`, etc., for history, events, and hooks.

  - **Updated Interfaces:** The `LLMProvider` interface and related options types (`StreamTextOptions`, `StreamObjectOptions`) have been updated to reflect these new standardized callback types and error-throwing expectations.

  These changes lead to more predictable behavior, improved debugging capabilities through structured errors, and a more consistent experience when working with different LLM providers.

## 0.1.1

- ðŸš€ **Introducing VoltAgent: TypeScript AI Agent Framework!**

  This initial release marks the beginning of VoltAgent, a powerful toolkit crafted for the JavaScript developer community. We saw the challenges: the complexity of building AI from scratch, the limitations of No-Code tools, and the lack of first-class AI tooling specifically for JS.

  ![VoltAgent Demo](https://cdn.voltagent.dev/readme/demo.gif)
  VoltAgent aims to fix that by providing the building blocks you need:

  - **`@voltagent/core`**: The foundational engine for agent capabilities.
  - **`@voltagent/voice`**: Easily add voice interaction.
  - **`@voltagent/vercel-ai`**: Seamless integration with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).
  - **`@voltagent/xsai`**: A Seamless integration with [xsAI](https://xsai.js.org/).
  - **`@voltagent/cli` & `create-voltagent-app`**: Quick start tools to get you building _fast_.

  We're combining the flexibility of code with the clarity of visual tools (like our **currently live [VoltAgent Console](https://console.voltagent.dev/)**) to make AI development easier, clearer, and more powerful. Join us as we build the future of AI in JavaScript!
