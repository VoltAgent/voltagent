# @voltagent/xsai

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#77](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/77) [`beaa8fb`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/beaa8fb1f1bc6351f1bede0b65a6a189cc1b6ea2) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - **API & Providers:** Standardized message content format for array inputs.

  - The API (`/text`, `/stream`, `/object`, `/stream-object` endpoints) now strictly expects the `content` field within message objects (when `input` is an array) to be either a `string` or an `Array` of content parts (e.g., `[{ type: 'text', text: '...' }]`).
  - The previous behavior of allowing a single content object (e.g., `{ type: 'text', ... }`) directly as the value for `content` in message arrays is no longer supported in the API schema. Raw string inputs remain unchanged.
  - Provider logic (`google-ai`, `groq-ai`, `xsai`) updated to align with this stricter definition.

  **Console:**

  - **Added file and image upload functionality to the Assistant Chat.** Users can now attach multiple files/images via a button, preview attachments, and send them along with text messages.
  - Improved the Assistant Chat resizing: Replaced size toggle buttons with a draggable handle (top-left corner).
  - Chat window dimensions are now saved to local storage and restored on reload.

  **Internal:**

  - Added comprehensive test suites for Groq and XsAI providers.

## 0.1.1

- ðŸš€ **Introducing VoltAgent: TypeScript AI Agent Framework!**

  This initial release marks the beginning of VoltAgent, a powerful toolkit crafted for the JavaScript developer community. We saw the challenges: the complexity of building AI from scratch, the limitations of No-Code tools, and the lack of first-class AI tooling specifically for JS.

  ![VoltAgent Demo](https://cdn.voltagent.dev/readme/demo.gif)
  VoltAgent aims to fix that by providing the building blocks you need:

  - **`@voltagent/core`**: The foundational engine for agent capabilities.
  - **`@voltagent/voice`**: Easily add voice interaction.
  - **`@voltagent/vercel-ai`**: Seamless integration with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).
  - **`@voltagent/xsai`**: A Seamless integration with [xsAI](https://xsai.js.org/).
  - **`@voltagent/cli` & `create-voltagent-app`**: Quick start tools to get you building _fast_.

  We're combining the flexibility of code with the clarity of visual tools (like our **currently live [VoltAgent Console](https://console.voltagent.dev/)**) to make AI development easier, clearer, and more powerful. Join us as we build the future of AI in JavaScript!
