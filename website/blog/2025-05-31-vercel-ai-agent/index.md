## Tracking Vercel AI Agents in Production

[Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction/) is today one of the most popular tools to create AI agents. That SDK is so popular among developers because of its TypeScript-first approach and inclusion of such cutting-edge AI features like streaming, tool usage, and multi-modal support right out of the box. We wrote about this [in our previous blog post](https://voltagent.dev/blog/vercel-ai-sdk/).

![Vercel AI SDK Integration](https://cdn.voltagent.dev/docs/vercel-ai-observability-demo/vercel-ai-demo-with-multi-agent.gif)

You can plug dozens of providers from OpenAI to Anthropic, Google to Groq with a single unified API. This _seriously_ speeds up development.

But check out the problem.

"I'm building awesome agents with Vercel AI SDK but I have _no clue what's happening in production_".

Sound familiar?

Building AI agents is easier with frameworks. You can do amazing things in a handful of lines of code with Vercel AI SDK. VoltAgent is the same; it is an AI agent framework on TypeScript where you can build production-strength agents with advanced capabilities like multi-agent systems, tool usage, and memory management.

But then comes the _production nightmare_: You don't know what tools your agent is executing, you can't see conversation flows, you can't monitor performance.

<!-- truncate -->

When we're building VoltAgent, I kept asking myself "What's my agent doing now?" Traditional monitoring tools? Not so effective for AI applications.

So we built the VoltAgent LLM monitoring platform. And today I have an _awesome_ announcement.

## What is Framework-Independent Monitoring

VoltAgent is actually two:

1. Open source TypeScript framework to create AI Agents
2. **Monitoring platform independent of frameworks**

The latter is quite crucial. You may be using Vercel AI SDK, someone else may be using LangChain, somebody else may be making plain vanilla OpenAI API calls.

_We can monitor them all._

So you don't need to write the VoltAgent framework for monitoring. You can have end-to-end visibility with literally zero modifications to your existing code.

## Why Framework-Independent Approach?

Honestly, we started by thinking about just the VoltAgent framework. But then we thought that _everyone has different tastes_:

- Some are just crazy about Vercel AI (for fast development)
- Some prefer LangChain (for Python universe)
- Some use pure OpenAI API (for full control)

And businesses usually have mixed strategies. Compelling everyone to use the same framework... _that's unrealistic_.

So we said "Let's make monitoring framework-independent". You use whatever framework you like, we'll do the monitoring.

## 1-Minute Setup: No Kidding

Now let me demonstrate how to set this up for Vercel AI SDK.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @voltagent/vercel-ai-exporter @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
```

Just 3 packages. That's all.

### API Keys

Go to [console.voltagent.dev](https://console.voltagent.dev), create an organization, create a project, get your keys:

- `VOLTAGENT_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `VOLTAGENT_SECRET_KEY`

:::warning Security Note
Keep your secret key safe! Never commit it to your repository. Always use environment variables in production.
:::

### OpenTelemetry Setup

In your main file, do this:

```typescript
import { VoltAgentExporter } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai-exporter";
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";

const voltAgentExporter = new VoltAgentExporter({
  publicKey: process.env.VOLTAGENT_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.VOLTAGENT_SECRET_KEY,
  debug: true, // for development
});

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: voltAgentExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});

sdk.start();
```

That's it. Seriously.

## Level 1: Just Turn On Tracking

Insert a single line in your current Vercel AI code:

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: "Hello, how are you?",
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true, // ‚Üê That's it!
  },
});
```

And done! üéâ

You may look at your agent in the VoltAgent console. It will be displayed by default as "ai-assistant" but _no problems_. For the moment, your calls to AI are being tracked, you can look at the execution flow.

You'll have a message like this in the console:

```
üìã VoltAgent: Using default agent for tracking.
üí° For improved tracking, add agentId to your metadata
```

:::tip Don't Worry!
This message is completely normal! VoltAgent automatically uses a default agent when no `agentId` is provided. This is actually helpful for getting started quickly. You can always customize it later.
:::

Don't worry about this, this is normal. Let's move on to the next step for improved tracking.

## Level 2: Name Your Agent

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { z } from "zod";

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: "What's the weather in Tokyo?",
  tools: {
    weather: {
      description: "Get the weather in a place",
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe("The place to get the weather for"),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
        return {
          location,
          temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
        };
      },
    },
  },
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      agentId: "weather-assistant", // ‚Üê Now it has a name!
      instructions: "You are a helpful weather assistant",
    },
  },
});
```

**What's the difference?**

- You see "weather-assistant" in the console rather than "ai-assistant"
- You see tool usage - which tool was applied when, inputs/outputs
- You can view instructions as documentation

Seriously, this is _very_ useful already.

## Level 3: Production-Ready Tracking

In production, you have users and conversations. You'd like to track those as well:

```typescript
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: "What's the weather like in Berlin?",
  tools: {
    weather: {
      // identical weather tool
    },
  },
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      agentId: "weather-assistant",
      instructions: "You are a helpful weather assistant",
      userId: "demo-user", // ‚Üê User tracking
      conversationId: "weather-chat", // ‚Üê Conversation grouping
      tags: ["weather", "demo", "production"], // ‚Üê Categorization
    },
  },
});
```

At this point you have _enterprise-level_ monitoring:

- User behavior analysis
- Conversation flow tracking
- Tag-based filtering and analytics
- Critical data for support

:::info Framework Flexibility
The best part? You can use this same approach with any AI framework. Whether your team uses Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, or direct OpenAI calls - all the tracking data appears in the same unified dashboard.
:::

## Level 4: Multi-Agent Coordination

Most advanced section. When multiple agents collaborate:

```typescript
// Main agent: Planning
const { text: plan } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: "Write a plan for team meeting",
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      agentId: "planning-agent",
      userId: "team-lead",
      conversationId: "meeting-organization",
      instructions: "You develop meeting plans and agendas",
      tags: ["planning", "meetings"],
    },
  },
});

// Child agent: Execution
const { text: execution } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: `Execute this plan: ${plan}`,
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      agentId: "execution-agent",
      parentAgentId: "planning-agent", // ‚Üê Parent relationship!
      userId: "team-lead",
      conversationId: "meeting-organization",
      instructions: "You handle meeting logistics and execution",
      tags: ["execution", "logistics"],
    },
  },
});
```

**What does this give you?**

- You can see agent hierarchies
- Parent-child relationships
- Complex workflow tracking
- Cross-agent context

In the console you have _a whole diagram_ of how agents are talking to each other.

## What Do You See in the Console?

Now my favorite part. When you launch the VoltAgent console:

- **Real-time agent activity dashboard** - You can view what the agents are doing currently, in real time
- **Conversation flows** - Timeline of all conversations, tool usage
- **Performance analytics** - Response times, token usage, cost tracking
- **Error debugging** - Where it stopped, which tool was failing
- **User analytics** - Who uses it how often

There was a bug over the weekend in production. Usually I would spend hours debugging. Caught it in the console in 2 minutes - there was a timeout on a specific tool call. _Life saver_ indeed.

## How It All Works Together

Here's what happens behind the scenes when you add VoltAgent observability to your Vercel AI calls:

`}
/>

This flow happens automatically once you add the `experimental_telemetry` flag. No additional code changes needed!

## Production Best Practices

Some _real life_ tips:

### Use Meaningful Agent IDs

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad examples:
agentId: "agent1", "my-agent", "assistant";

// ‚úÖ Good examples:
agentId: "customer-support-bot", "content-writer", "code-reviewer";
```

### Don't Forget User ID

```typescript
experimental_telemetry: {
  isEnabled: true,
  metadata: {
    agentId: "customer-support-bot",
    userId: req.user.id, // Or session.userId, auth.userId
  },
}
```

:::caution Critical for Analytics
Without user ID tracking, you can't do user behavior analysis, can't identify power users, and can't debug user-specific issues. This metadata is crucial for production applications!
:::

Without this you can't do user behavior analysis.

### Conversation ID Strategy

```typescript
// Generate once at conversation start, then reuse
const conversationId = `conv_${Date.now()}_${userId}`;

experimental_telemetry: {
  isEnabled: true,
  metadata: {
    agentId: "chat-assistant",
    userId: "user-123",
    conversationId, // Same ID for all the messages in this conversation
  },
}
```

### Use Tags Strategically

```typescript
tags: [
  "content-creation", // Feature category
  "high-priority", // Priority level
  "marketing-team", // Department
  "blog-post", // Content type
];
```

Then in the console you can say "Show me all high-priority content-creation activities".

## Framework Agnostic Approach

This is the _coolest_ thing I think. Not just Vercel AI:

- **Python apps** (LangChain, etc.)
- **Direct OpenAI API calls**
- **Custom agent frameworks**
- **Multi-language integration**

So your team member is implementing Python LangChain, you're implementing Vercel AI, another team member is implementing plain OpenAI. _All of them are on the same dashboard_.

This is indeed a game-changer. Since real companies always have hybrid tech stacks.

## Real-World Example: Customer Support Bot

Here is an example. You have a customer support chatbot:

```typescript
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: `Customer issue: ${customerIssue}`,
  tools: {
    ticketLookup: {
      /* lookup from ticket database */
    },
    knowledgeBase: {
      /* knowledge base search */
    },
    escalateToHuman: {
      /* escalate to human agent */
    },
  },
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      agentId: "customer-support-bot",
      userId: customerId,
      conversationId: ticketId,
      tags: ["support", "customer-service", customerTier],
      // Custom business data
      ticketId,
      customerTier: "premium",
      department: "support",
    },
  },
});
```

Things you can view in the console:

- Which customers utilize support the most
- Which tools are utilized most
- Average resolution time
- Escalation patterns
- Agent performance metrics

_With this data_ you can optimize your support team. Which topics need more training, which tools need to be optimized, etc.

## Getting Started

If you are using Vercel AI SDK, you can literally deploy this in minutes:

1. **Install the packages**
2. **Get your API keys** ([console.voltagent.dev](https://console.voltagent.dev))
3. **Set up OpenTelemetry**
4. **Add `experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true }`**

That's it.

First, start with basic tracking. Then gradually add metadata, supply agent IDs, enable user tracking.

## Final Words

AI development is moving very fast. But we are still at the _stone age_ of monitoring.

The traditional APM tools are not enough for AI-specific needs. AI systems have their own share of challenges - tool calls, agent interactions, conversation flow, multi-modal data.

VoltAgent monitoring tries to fill this gap. And because it's framework-agnostic, you can use it on _your existing code_ with minimal alterations.

Test it and give feedback. We always discuss new features in our community ([Discord](https://s.voltagent.dev/discord)).

_Seeing what your AI agents do is no longer a dream. Go and see what your agents are really doing!_ ‚ö°
