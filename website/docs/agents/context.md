# Operation Context (`userContext`)

VoltAgent provides a powerful mechanism called `userContext` to pass custom data through the lifecycle of a single agent operation (like a `generateText` or `streamObject` call). This context is isolated to each individual operation, ensuring that data doesn't leak between concurrent or subsequent requests.

## What is `userContext`?

`userContext` is a property within the `OperationContext` object. `OperationContext` itself encapsulates information about a specific agent task, including its unique ID (`operationId`), the associated history entry, and event tracking details.

`userContext` is specifically a `Map<string | symbol, unknown>`.

- **Map**: It allows you to store key-value pairs.
- **Keys**: Can be strings or symbols, providing flexibility in how you identify your context data.
- **Values**: Can be of `unknown` type, meaning you can store virtually any kind of data â€“ strings, numbers, objects, custom class instances, etc.

## Why Use `userContext`?

`userContext` solves the problem of needing to maintain and access request-specific state or data across different parts of an agent's execution flow, particularly between lifecycle hooks and tool executions.

Common use cases include:

1.  **Tracing & Logging**: Propagate unique request IDs or trace IDs generated at the start (`onStart`) into tool executions for distributed tracing or detailed logging.
2.  **Request-Specific Configuration**: Pass configuration details relevant only to the current operation (e.g., user preferences, tenant IDs) from `onStart` to tools.
3.  **Metrics & Analytics**: Store timing information or other metrics in `onStart` and finalize/report them in `onEnd`.
4.  **Resource Management**: Store references to resources allocated in `onStart` (like database connections specific to the request) and release them in `onEnd`.
5.  **Passing Data Between Hooks**: Set a value in `onStart` and retrieve it in `onEnd` for the same operation.

## How it Works

1.  **Initialization**: When an agent operation (e.g., `agent.generateText(...)`) begins, VoltAgent creates a unique `OperationContext`.
2.  **Empty Map**: Within this context, `userContext` is initialized as an empty `Map`.
3.  **Access via Hooks**: The `OperationContext` (including `userContext`) is passed as an argument to the `onStart` and `onEnd` agent lifecycle hooks.
4.  **Access via Tools**: The `OperationContext` is also accessible within a tool's `execute` function via the optional `options` parameter (specifically `options.operationContext`).
5.  **Isolation**: Each call to an agent generation method (`generateText`, `streamText`, etc.) gets its own independent `OperationContext` and `userContext`. Data stored in one operation's `userContext` is not visible to others.

## Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to set context data in the `onStart` hook and access it in both the `onEnd` hook and within a tool's `execute` function.

```typescript
import {
  Agent,
  createHooks,
  createTool,
  type OperationContext,
  type ToolExecutionContext,
} from "@voltagent/core";
import { z } from "zod";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Define hooks that set and retrieve data
const hooks = createHooks({
  onStart: (agent: Agent<any>, context: OperationContext) => {
    // Set a unique request ID for this operation
    const requestId = `req-${Date.now()}`;
    context.userContext.set("requestId", requestId);
    console.log(`[${agent.name}] Operation started. RequestID: ${requestId}`);
  },
  onEnd: (agent: Agent<any>, result: any, context: OperationContext) => {
    // Retrieve the request ID at the end of the operation
    const requestId = context.userContext.get("requestId");
    console.log(`[${agent.name}] Operation finished. RequestID: ${requestId}`);
    // Use this ID for logging, metrics, cleanup, etc.
  },
});

// Define a tool that uses the context data set in onStart
const customContextTool = createTool({
  name: "custom_context_logger",
  description: "Logs a message using the request ID from the user context.",
  parameters: z.object({
    message: z.string().describe("The message to log."),
  }),
  execute: async (params: { message: string }, options?: ToolExecutionContext) => {
    // Access userContext via options.operationContext
    const requestId = options?.operationContext?.userContext?.get("requestId") || "unknown-request";
    const logMessage = `[RequestID: ${requestId}] Tool Log: ${params.message}`;
    console.log(logMessage);
    // In a real scenario, you might interact with external systems using this ID
    return `Logged message with RequestID: ${requestId}`;
  },
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "MyCombinedAgent",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: [customContextTool],
  hooks: hooks,
});

// Trigger the agent.
await agent.generateText(
  "Log the following information using the custom logger: 'User feedback received.'"
);

// Console output will show logs from onStart, the tool (if called), and onEnd,
```

In this example:

1.  The `onStart` hook generates a `requestId` and stores it in `userContext`.
2.  If the LLM decides to use the `custom_context_logger` tool, the tool's `execute` function accesses the `requestId` from `userContext` via the `options.operationContext` provided to it.
3.  The `onEnd` hook retrieves the same `requestId` from the context, demonstrating that the data persisted throughout the operation's lifecycle.
