# Multimodal Tracing

VoltOps provides comprehensive observability for multimodal AI applications, tracking interactions across text, images, audio, video, and other data types. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated in processing multiple modalities simultaneously, proper observability becomes crucial for understanding system behavior and optimizing performance.

## What is Multimodality in LLM Observability?

Multimodality in LLM observability refers to an AI system's ability to process and understand multiple data types (modalities) simultaneously. Rather than being limited to text-only interactions, modern AI applications can handle:

- **Text**: Traditional language processing, conversations, documents
- **Images**: Visual understanding, image analysis, computer vision tasks
- **Audio**: Speech recognition, audio analysis, voice interactions
- **Video**: Motion understanding, temporal analysis, multimedia content
- **Structured Data**: Tables, JSON, databases, APIs
- **Code**: Programming languages, technical documentation, software analysis

## Why Multimodal Tracing Matters

### Complex Input Processing

Modern AI applications often receive mixed-media inputs requiring different processing pipelines. VoltOps tracks how each modality flows through your system, helping you understand processing bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

### Cross-Modal Decision Making

AI agents frequently make decisions based on information from multiple sources. Tracing reveals how text prompts, visual context, and audio cues combine to influence agent behavior.

### Performance Optimization

Different modalities have varying computational costs and processing times. Multimodal tracing helps identify which data types are expensive to process and where optimization efforts should focus.

### Error Analysis Across Modalities

When multimodal AI fails, the issue could originate from any input type. Comprehensive tracing helps isolate whether problems stem from text understanding, image processing, audio quality, or cross-modal integration.
