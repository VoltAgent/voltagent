      question:
        "My application isn't written in VoltAgent. Will VoltOps be useful?",
      answer:
        "Yes! VoltOps LLM Observability works with JS/TS, Python, Vercel AI SDK and various frameworks, not just VoltAgent. Our REST API and webhook integrations allow you to send traces from Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, or any other language.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can VoltOps help with observability and evaluation?",
      answer:
        "VoltOps provides comprehensive LLM observability with detailed traces, token usage tracking, cost analysis, performance metrics, and user session monitoring. You can evaluate your AI agents' performance, debug issues in real-time, and optimize your applications based on production data insights.",
    },
    {
      question: "What counts as a trace in VoltOps?",
      answer:
        "A trace represents a single execution flow through your AI agent or application. This includes LLM calls, tool usage, function calls, and any nested operations that occur during a single request or conversation turn. Each user interaction that triggers your AI system typically generates one trace.",
    },

      question: "How does VoltOps pricing work with trace overages?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          VoltOps Pro plan includes 5,000 traces per month for $50. If you
          exceed this limit, you'll be charged $10 for every additional 5,000
          traces.{" "}

      question:
        "I can't have data leave my environment. Can I self-host VoltOps?",
      answer:
        "Yes! VoltOps Enterprise plan includes self-hosted deployment options. You can run VoltOps entirely within your own infrastructure, ensuring your sensitive AI application data never leaves your environment while still getting full monitoring capabilities.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where is VoltOps data stored?",
      answer:
        "For our cloud offering, VoltOps data is securely stored in SOC 2 compliant data centers with encryption at rest and in transit. For Enterprise customers, we offer self-hosted options where all data remains in your own infrastructure and never leaves your environment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will VoltOps add latency to my application?",
      answer:
        "VoltOps is designed for minimal performance impact. Our SDKs send data asynchronously in the background, typically adding less than 1ms of overhead. The monitoring happens without blocking your AI application's main execution flow.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will you train on the data that I send VoltOps?",
      answer:
        "No, absolutely not. VoltOps never uses your data to train models or for any other purpose beyond providing you with monitoring and analytics. Your AI application data is strictly used only for observability features and remains completely private to your organization.",
